        "description": "Everyday, #Netflix handles billions of requests regarding movies, trailers and other video content. Delivering at such a large scale needs an #engineering marvel. This #video will talk about how Netflix is able to onboard new video content onto their platform. We go from video chunking to collating 4 second shots into scenes.\n\nAmazon S3 is used to store the video chunks. Netflix also provides open connect servers to internet service providers, which acts like a cache of movies. Most requests to Netflix can be served by this cache, and the remaining are sent over the network. This reduces the bandwidth and time required for Netflix to operate at scale.
