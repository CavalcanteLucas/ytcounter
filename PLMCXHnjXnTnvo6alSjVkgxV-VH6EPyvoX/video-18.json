In this model, events are produced by a publishing service and consumed by downstream services.\n\nDesigning the micro service interactions involves event handling and consistency checks. We look into a pub-sub architecture to evaluate it's advantages and disadvantages compared to a request response architecture.\n\nThis type of architecture relies on message queues to ensure event passing. An example would be rabbitMQ or Kafka. The architecture is common in real life scenarios and interviews.\n\nIf there is no strong consistency guarantee to made for transactions, an event model is good to use in microservices.
