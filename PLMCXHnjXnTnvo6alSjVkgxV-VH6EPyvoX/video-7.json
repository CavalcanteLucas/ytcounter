        "description": "Sharding a database is a common scalability strategy used when designing server side systems. The server side system architecture uses concepts like sharding to make systems more scalable, reliable and performant.\n\nSharding is horizontal partitioning of data according to a shard key. This shard key determines which database the entry to be persisted is sent to. Some common strategies for this are reverse proxies.\n\nDatabase interviews ask for concepts like sharding to make databases more performant and available.
