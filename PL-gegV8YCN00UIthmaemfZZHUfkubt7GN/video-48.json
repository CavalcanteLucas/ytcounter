        "title": "Lesson 48 - Thread Delegate Pattern",
        "description": "The Thread Delegate pattern of reactive architecture allows systems to grow automatically as your company grows without human intervention. This unique and powerful pattern is also used to develop high-performance systems and also used to run up to thousands of parallel processes while still maintaining the processing order of messages (not just the order in which they are received). In this lesson Mark Richards describes and demonstrates the Thread Delegate pattern using the Java API and simple messaging using RabbitMQ.
