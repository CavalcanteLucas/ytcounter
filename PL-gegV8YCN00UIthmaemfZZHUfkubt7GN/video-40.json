In this follow-on lesson, Mark leverages a real-world stock trading example along with code using Apache Camel and describes five of the more common integration architecture patterns. Although Mark will be showing an implementation using Apache Camel for each pattern, it is not necessary to know (or even care about) Apache Camel. It is only used to provide a concrete example and implementation of each integration pattern.
