These days I like to call ESBs \u201cIntegration Hubs\u201d. Same thing, different name. What\u2019s changed? Mostly a better understanding of when to use them and how to use them effectively. In this lesson Mark Richards shows when to consider using an integration hub and the core capabilities they provide. Forget SOA - integration hubs are a very valuable part of decoupling systems, and don\u2019t need to be overly complex.
